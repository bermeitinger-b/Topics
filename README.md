# Demonstrator: Topics – Easy Topic Modeling

## First Steps

Although this application is built with Python, it is possible to run it as if it was a native application, without having to install Python or any related packages. There is currently only one build for macOS, soon also for Windows.

## Running the application

1. Download `demonstrator-mac-0.0.1.dmg` from the [release-section]().
2. Open it by double-clicking.
3. Drag the app into your `Applications` folder – or into any folder at all.
4. Run the app by double-clicking.
5. If you get an error message saying that the file is from an “unidentified developer”, you can override it by holding control while double-clicking. The error message will still appear, but you will be given an option to run the file anyway.
